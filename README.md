This repository contains code and documentation for predicting survival outcomes from the Titanic dataset as part of the Kaggle competition.
It includes data exploration, preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation metrics. 
The project serves as a practical guide for implementing machine learning models to classify survival based on passenger features.
